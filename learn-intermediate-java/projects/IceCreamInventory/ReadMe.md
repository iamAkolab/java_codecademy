# Ice Cream Inventory
Congratulations, you have just landed a new contract to build out an application for a new local ice cream shop in town! They need a program that will help them sort and keep track of their inventory of ice cream, shakes, slushies, and smoothies. This Java program will have to keep count of how many of each product the shop sells.
