# Threading in the Gym
It’s time to go to the gym and get THREADED!!! 🏋🏼‍♀️🏋🏿💪🏽

In this project, you will be creating a program to represent a gym. We have provided you with some supporting files to build the backbone of the gym, but you will be doing most of the heavy lifting. Don’t worry, the gym puns will definitely continue. 😉

In this gym, we want all of our members to be able to work out at the same time instead of waiting in line outside until the person in front of them is done. To solve this problem, we will implement a thread for each member so they can all work out concurrently.

Let’s get started!
