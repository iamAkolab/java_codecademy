# Welcome to Java for Programmers

## A (Very) Brief History of Java
The Java programming language was designed by James Gosling and released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. The goal of Java was to be a powerful, yet simple object-oriented programming language that was platform-independent. Java can be found in video games, mobile applications, desktop applications, and more.

## The Cycle of a Java Program
Java code gets written in a .java file. When we run our program, the code gets compiled into bytecode which is a machine language that the JVM can understand. Bytecode gets sent to the JVM where it is analyzed and then executed as instructions. The JVM terminates once it executes the final instruction!
