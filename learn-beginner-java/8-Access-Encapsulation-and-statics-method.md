# Access, Encapsulation, and Scope
## What are Access and Scope?

As our Java programs begin to get bigger and we begin to have multiple Objects and Classes [Docs A class is a blueprint or template for an object in Java.] that interact with each other, the concepts of access and scope come into play. To oversimplify things, the concepts of access and scope both center around what parts of your programs can interact with specific variables [Docs Variables are used whenever there’s a need to store a piece of data and ensures code re-usability.] or methods [Methods are reusable pieces of code in classes. The difference between a method and a function is that methods are always related to a class or an object.] from other parts of your program. Let’s take a brief look at some of the concepts we’ll cover:

### Access
* The public and private keywords and how they relate to Classes, variables, constructors [Constructors are like normal methods within the class, but are used to initialize the object of the class.], and methods
* The concept of encapsulation
* Accessor methods, sometimes known as “getters”
* Mutator methods, sometimes known as “setters”

### Scope
* Local variables vs. instance variables
* The this keyword
