# Variables and Types
---
## Declaring a Variable
To declare a variable with a value, use the following syntax:
```
dataType variableName = value;
```
To declare a variable without a value, use this syntax instead:
```
dataType variableName;
```
To assign or change a variable value, state the name of the variable followed by the assignment operator (=) and the new value:
```
variableName = newValue;
```
## Types of Data
In Java, there are several primitive, or built-in, data types:

### int
ints store whole number values between -2147483648 and 2147483647.
```
int moonLanding = 1969;
```
### double
doubles store decimal number values between 4.9E-324 and 1.7976931348623157E+308:
```
double PI = 3.14;
```
### boolean
booleans store true or false values:
```
boolean isRaining = true;
boolean isSunny = false;
```
### char
chars store single character values:
```
char firstLetter = 'a';
```

## Manipulating Number-Based Variables
### Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic Operators can be used to change the value of a number-based variable. These operators can be used for addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and getting the remainder (%):
```
int num = 3 + 2; // num now equals 5
num = num - 1; // num now equals 4
num = 4 * 4; // num now equals 16
num = num / 2; // num now equals 8
num = num % 5; // num now equals 3
```
### Compound Assignment Operators
Compound assignment operators perform an arithmetic operation on a variable and then reassigns its value in one step. The compound assignment operator is made up of one arithmetic operator immediately followed by the assignment operator:
```
int num = 3;
num += 2; // num now equals 5
num -= 1; // num now equals 4
num *= 4; // num now equals 16
num /= 2; // num now equals 8
num %= 5; // num now equals 3
```
### Increment and Decrement Operators
The increment operator ++ increases a number value by 1 while the decrement operator decreases a number value by 1:

// Increment:
int age = 47;
age++; // age now equals 48
// Decrement:
int apples = 7;
apples--; // apples now equals 6

## Strings
Another common data type in Java is the String. Strings are a reference data type because they are objects from the String class. Strings hold sequences of characters contained within double quotes (").
```
// Option 1 for declaring a String
String greetings = "Greetings, earthlings!";
// Option 2 for declaring a String
String request = new String("Take me to your leader.");
```

# final Keyword
To declare a variable with a value that cannot be manipulated, we need to use the final keyword. For example, the year we were born will always stay the same. Thereâ€™s no way we can change that information. A value like this in our code should be unchangeable.
To use the final keyword, prepend final to a variable declaration like so:
```
final int yearBorn = 1968;
```
When we declare a variable using final, the value cannot be changed; any attempts at doing so will cause an error to occur:
```
error: cannot assign a value to final variable yearBorn
```
