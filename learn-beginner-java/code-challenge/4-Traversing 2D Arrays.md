# Code Challenge: Traversing 2D Arrays
2D arrays allow us to create and store data within rows and columns. Using iteration, we can traverse through these values to gather information about the data. In this activity, we’ll focus on traversing 2D arrays to gather information about a set of data.

Four wildlife researchers in Victoria, Australia spent five days counting the number of koalas they came across in different areas. Their numbers were as follows:

| Noor | Edward | Camila | Amir |
| ---— | —----- | —----- | —--- |
| Day 1 | 17 | 13 | 19 | 22 |
| Day 2 | 12 | 18 | 25 | 20 |
| Day 3 | 15 | 18 | 21 | 24 |
| Day 4 | 19 | 23 | 23 | 22 |
| Day 5 | 18 | 20 | 21 | 26 |

The researchers want to use this chart to gather some information regarding their trip using Java. This type of data would be very fitting for a 2D array.
