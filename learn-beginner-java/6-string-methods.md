# String Methods
The Java **`String`** class has many useful methods to help us perform operations and data manipulation on them. We don’t have to import anything to use the  **`String`** class because it’s a part of the **`java.lang`** package, which is available by default.

In this article, we will go over the following String methods:

* .length()
* .concat()
* .equals()
* .indexOf()
* .charAt()
* .substring()
* .toUpperCase() / .toLowerCase()
