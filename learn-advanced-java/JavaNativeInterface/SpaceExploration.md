# Space Exploration
Itâ€™s time to implement your JNI skills to a project of your own!

## Download the Starting and Solution Code
Before we start writing code, download the folder containing the starting and solution code of the project here https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/learn-advanced-java/JNI/Project.zip. 
The /starter folder contains code to help you get started while the /solution folder will contain the solution if you get stuck. You can also compare the solution provided to your own after you complete the project.

The /starter folder contains two files:
* SpaceTravel.cpp
* SpaceTravel.java
  
The /solution folder contains three files:

* SpaceTravel.cpp
* SpaceTravel.java
* SpaceTravel.h (This file is generated through your terminal when you compile and generate .h files.)

You will be doing this project outside of the Codecademy platform on your computer using your own text editor or IDE. If you need help setting up your text editor, read our article about setting up a text editor for web development.
