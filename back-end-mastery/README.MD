# Backend Mastery 2026

A structured, 7-week learning journey to master modern backend engineering — aligned with 2026 industry demands.

## 🎯 Goals
- Build deep expertise across 7 core domains
- Implement hands-on labs with real-world constraints
- Integrate all skills into a capstone trading agent backend
- Emphasize **security**, **observability**, and **compliance-ready design**

## 🗓️ Weekly Roadmap

| Week | Domain                          | Primary Goal                              | Deliverable                                                                 |

| 1    | API & Interface Design           | Design robust, versioned APIs             | REST v1/v2 + gRPC service with backward-compatible contracts                 |
| 2    | Data Management                  | Optimize data access & storage            | SQL-tuned queries + NoSQL sharding simulation + vector DB for RAG            |
| 3    | Concurrency & Performance        | Write safe, efficient async code          | Thread-safe cache + async pipeline with profiling report                     |
| 4    | Distributed Systems & Messaging  | Build resilient event-driven services     | Idempotent Kafka consumer + service mesh configuration                       |
| 5    | Security & Identity              | Implement modern auth & harden system     | Passkey + OAuth2 flow + OWASP Top 10 vulnerability scan                      |
| 6    | Observability & Reliability      | Make system debuggable in production      | OpenTelemetry traces + integrated Grafana dashboard (logs, metrics, traces)  |
| 7    | Deployment & Infrastructure      | Automate reliable delivery                | GitOps pipeline (ArgoCD/Flux) + edge caching strategy (Redis + CDN)          |

> Each week includes labs, challenges, and integration into the `capstone-project/`.
