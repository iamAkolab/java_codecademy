# Week 4: Distributed Systems & Messaging

## 🎯 Goal
Build resilient, event-driven microservices with idempotency and retries.

## ✅ Tasks
1. Set up local Kafka (or Redpanda)
2. Write a producer that emits trade events
3. Build an idempotent consumer with deduplication
4. Simulate network failure and test recovery

## 🧪 Challenge
> Ensure no duplicate portfolio updates after 3 retries.
