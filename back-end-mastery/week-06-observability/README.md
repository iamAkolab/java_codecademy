# Week 6: Observability & Reliability

## 🎯 Goal
Make every component debuggable in production.

## ✅ Tasks
1. Instrument service with OpenTelemetry (auto + manual spans)
2. Ship logs/metrics/traces to Grafana stack (Loki, Prometheus, Tempo)
3. Create dashboard showing error rate, latency, throughput
4. Simulate failure and trace root cause

## 🧪 Challenge
> Reduce mean time to diagnose (MTTD) for a silent latency spike.

## 📁 Labs
- `labs/opentelemetry-instrumentation/`
- `labs/grafana-dashboard/`

➡️ **Next**: Add to `capstone-project/telemetry/`
