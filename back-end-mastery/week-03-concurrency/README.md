# Week 3: Concurrency & Performance

## 🎯 Goal
Write safe, efficient concurrent code with clear performance trade-offs.

## ✅ Tasks
1. Build an async pipeline that processes market ticks
2. Implement a thread-safe in-memory cache with immutability
3. Profile CPU/memory usage (e.g., with `pprof` or `py-spy`)
4. Compare latency vs throughput under load

## 🧪 Challenge
> Eliminate a race condition or memory leak in your pipeline.

## 📁 Labs

- `labs/thread-safe-cache/`

➡️ **Next**: Plug into `capstone-project/engine/`
